How to Use the Music Player

    Save the Bash script (play_music.sh) with the logic to play your music file using VLC.
Make the script executable:   
      
    chmod +x play_music.sh
    
Replace the script path in the C program with the full path to your play_music.sh.
Compile the C program:
      
    gcc -o music_player music_player.c

Run the compiled program to start playing music:
      
    ./music_player
